## Specs

Do you know how the candy crush type games work? Write a function that receives a string and plays a candy crush game with it - removes letters when there are 3 or more the same letters in a row. We want this function to return what is left after all of the groups of letters have been removed.

Example: 

Input string: AABBCCCCBDDDADB 
After first round: AABBBADB 
After second round: AAADB 
After third round: DB 
Output: DB
